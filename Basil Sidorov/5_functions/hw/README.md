# HW
1. The function `max()` and `max_of_three()` from previous exercises 
will only work for two and three numbers, respectively. 
But suppose we have a much larger number of numbers, 
or suppose we cannot tell in advance how many they are? 
Write a function max_in_list() 
that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest one.
