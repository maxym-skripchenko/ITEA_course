# Practise

* Write test with 3-4 cases

1. Using the same Dog class, instantiate three new dogs, each with a different age and name.
Then write a function called, get_biggest_number(), that takes any number of ages (*args) 
and returns the oldest one. Then output the age of the oldest dog like so: 
`The oldest dog Sharik is 7 years old.`

2. Create a Pets class that holds instances of dogs, cats; 
this class is completely separate from the Dog or Cat classes.
In other words, the Dog or Cats classes does not inherit from the Pets class. 
Then assign three dog and cat instances to an instance of the Pets class.

3. Create base class `Vehicle` with main methods and attributes that share to other child classes.
Create 2-3 child classes. Create 2-3 methods and attributes in child classes.
Create 2-3 instances of each class and try to call each method.
