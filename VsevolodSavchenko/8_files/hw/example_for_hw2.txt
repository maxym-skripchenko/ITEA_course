Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using
Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces,
or using a hanging indent [7]. When using a hanging indent the following
should be considered; there should be no arguments on the first line and
further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a continuation line.
When the conditional part of an if-statement is long enough to require
that it be written across multiple lines, it's worth noting that the combination
of a two character keyword (i.e. if), plus a single space, plus an opening
 parenthesis creates a natural 4-space indent for the subsequent lines of
 the multiline conditional. This can produce a visual conflict with the
 indented suite of code nested inside the if-statement, which would also
 naturally be indented to 4 spaces. This PEP takes no explicit position
 on how (or whether) to further visually distinguish such conditional
 lines from the nested suite inside the if-statement. Acceptable options
 in this situation include, but are not limited to
