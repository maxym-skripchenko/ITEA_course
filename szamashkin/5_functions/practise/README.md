# Practise

* Write test with 3-4 cases

1. Define a function `max()` that takes two numbers as arguments 
and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct 
available in Python. (It is true that Python has the `max()` function 
built in, but writing it yourself is nevertheless a good exercise.)"""

2. Define a function that computes the length of a 
given list or string. (It is true that Python has 
the len() function built in, but writing it yourself 
is nevertheless a good exercise.)

3. Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a 
string of length 1) and returns True if it is a vowel, 
False otherwise.

4. Define a function `sum()` and a function `multiply()` that 
sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in a list 
of numbers. For example, `sum([1, 2, 3, 4])` should return 10, 
and `multiply([1, 2, 3, 4])` should return `24`.

5. Write a function `is_member()` that takes a value 
i.e. a number, string, etc) x and a list of values a, 
and returns True if x is a member of a, False otherwise. 
(Note that this is exactly what the `in` operator does, but 
for the sake of the exercise you should pretend Python 
did not have this operator.)

6. Define a function `overlapping()` that takes two lists and 
returns True if they have at least one member in common, 
False otherwise. You may use your `is_member()` function, 
or the in operator, but for the sake of the exercise, 
you should (also) write it using two nested for-loops.
