# Practise

* Write test with 3-4 cases

1. Pizzas:
Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. 
Store these pizza names in a list, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
    * Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza 
    instead of printing just the name of the pizza. 
    For each pizza you should have one line of output containing a simple statement like:
    `I like pepperoni pizza.`
    * Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, 
    that states how much you like pizza. 
    The output should consist of three or more lines about the kinds of pizza you 
    like and then an additional sentence, such as `I really love pizza!`

2. Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. 
    * Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal.
    * Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as: `A dog would make a great pet.`
    * Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. 

    You could print a sentence such as `Any of these animals would make a great pet!`

3. Buffet: 
A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods. 
Think of five simple foods, and store them in a tuple.
    * Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers.
    * Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the change.
    * The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different foods. 
    * Add a block of code that rewrites the tuple, and then use a for loop to print each of the items on the revised menu.
    * Use slicing for get last two items of foods.
    * Use slicing for get every second item of food.
    * Reverse your food order.

4. Person: 
    * Use a dictionary to store information about a person you know. 
    * Store their first name, last name, age, and the city in which they live. 
    * You should have keys such as first_name, last_name, age, and city. 
    * Print each piece of information stored in your dictionary.

5. Rivers: 
Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country each river runs through. 
One key-value pair might be `'nile': 'egypt'`.
    * Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such as The Nile runs through Egypt.
    * Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary.
    * Use a loop to print the name of each country included in the dictionary.
