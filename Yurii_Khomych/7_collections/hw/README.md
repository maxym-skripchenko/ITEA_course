# HW

* Write test with 3-4 cases

# Lists
1. Order your favorite pizza:
    * Create 3-4 lists with pizza ingredients groups (vegetables, meat_types...).
    * Create list with predefined pizzas. 
    * Ask user what pizza he want (custom or predefined).
    * Output variants of pizza or ingredient step by step
    * Return result of ordered pizza

2. My Pizzas, Your Pizzas: 
Make a copy of the list of pizzas, and call it friend_pizzas. Then, do the following:
    * Add a new pizza to the original list.
    * Add a different pizza to the list friend_pizzas.
    * Prove that you have two separate lists. 
    * Print the message, My favorite pizzas are:, and then use a for loop to print the first list. 
    * Print the message, My friend’s favorite pizzas are:, and then use a for loop to print the second list. 
    Make sure each new pizza is stored in the appropriate list.


3. List slices: 
    * Use a slice to print the first three items from that program’s list.
    * Use a slice to print three items from the middle of the list.
    * Reverse your list from first index to the end.
    * Use a slice to print the last three items in the list.

4. Favorite Numbers: 
    * Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers. 
    * Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. 
    * Think of a favorite number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. 
    * Print each person’s name and their favorite number. 
    * For even more fun, poll a few friends and get some actual data for your program.

5. Glossary: 
A Python dictionary can be used to model an actual dictionary. 
However, to avoid confusion, let’s call it a glossary.
    * Think of five programming words you’ve learned about in the previous chapters. 
    * Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their meanings as values.
    * Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. 
    * You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, 
    or print the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. 
    * Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning pair in your output.

6. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where the name of each dictionary is the name of a pet.
    * In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the owner’s name.
    * Store these dictionaries in a list called pets.
    * Next, loop through your list and as you do print everything you know about each pet.
