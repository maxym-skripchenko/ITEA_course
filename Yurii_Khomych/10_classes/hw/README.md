# HW

* Write test with 3-4 cases

1. Add for each class (Dog, Cat, etc.) attribute `is_hungry = True`
Then add a method called eat() which changes the value of `is_hungry` to `False` when called.
Create three instance of each class and call `eat` method.

2. Add a walk() method to Pets, Dog and Cats classes so that when you call the method on the Pets class, 
each dog or cat instance assigned to the Pets class will walk().
Start by implementing the method in the same manner as the speak() method. 
As for the method in the Pets class, you will need to iterate through the list of dogs, then call the method itself.
